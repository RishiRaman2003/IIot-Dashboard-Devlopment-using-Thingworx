# IIot-Dashboard-Devlopment-using-Thingworx
I present the development of IIoT dashboards using the ThingWorx platform for monitoring and controlling smart manufacturing stations. The system integrates PLC-driven units like ASRS, Turning Center, and more, with real-time data visualization and control using web-enabled dashboards. Data is acquired via Kepware and OPC protocols.
